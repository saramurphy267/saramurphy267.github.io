Welcome to my website! I am an atmospheric chemist with a special interest in the kinetics and mechanisms of bimolecular peroxy radical reactions. Currently, I am an [NSF Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellow](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/ags-prf-atmospheric-geospace-sciences-postdoctoral-research) at UCLA, working with [Tori Barber](https://www.dr-barber-phd.com/) to use a combination of chamber experiments and IR action spectroscopy to elucidate the mechanism and atmospheric impact of the peroxy radical self-reaction. In June I defended my Ph.D in Environmental Science and Engineering at Caltech, where I worked with [Paul Wennberg](https://wennberglab.caltech.edu/) to perform laboratory GC-CIMS studies of the self-reactions of alkene-derived peroxy radicals and field studies of alkyl nitrate formation in the urban atmosphere. I am generally fascinated by all things physical chemistry and the ways we can apply the fundamental concepts of physical chemistry to understand complex systems, like the atmosphere. 

Outside of research, I am passionate about education and education theory, especially thinking about ways in which higher education can be made more accessible to students from historically marginalized backgrounds. In addition, I minored in linguistics and am always interested in talking about languages, and why I think linguistics and chemistry are not as disparate as they might seem. I am also a bluegrass fiddle player, and am passionate about increasing access to music education. Finally, I am always ready to show off pictures of my cat!
