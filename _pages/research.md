## Laboratory Studies of Peroxy Radical Self-Reaction Kinetics

{% include module.html image_width="65%" padding="500px" image_path="../images/lab-photo.jpeg" description="In this work, I aim to measure the kinetics of peroxy radical self-reactions, specifically the pathway to the formation of a peroxide accretion product (ROOR). Using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, I aim to both quantify the formation of the ROOR and also identify these products by comparison against standards synthesized in the lab of [Brian Stoltz](https://www.stoltz.caltech.edu/brianstoltz) at Caltech. This work (see the publication [here](../publication/2023-accretionproductformationethene)) has focused on developing a method for the study of these reactions using ethene as a model system. I have also expanded this method to study more complex small alkenes and develop a better understanding for the structure-activity relationship of the formation of this product. In the future, I will use laboratory chamber experiments to more broadly examine the relationship between structure and atmospheric impact of these reactions." %}

## Laboratory and Field Studies of Ambient Organic Peroxy Radical Chemistry

{% include module2.html image_width="90%" padding="350px" image_path="../images/Field-Picture.jpg" description ="In 2021, I participated in the Re-Evaluating the Chemistry of Air Pollutants in California ([RECAP-CA](https://csl.noaa.gov/projects/sunvex/)) field campaign, deploying the Caltech GC-CIMS in Pasadena to gain a better understanding of the air quality in Southern California. With this data, and comparison to light and dark oxidation experiments in the lab, we identified the major organic nitrate compounds in the Los Angeles urban atmosphere in the gas- and particle-phases. In the future, I plan to continue to use mass spectrometry to sample the ambient atmosphere and connect the results of laboratory work with ambient observations." %}

## Mechanistic Investigations of Peroxy Radical Reactions

{% include module2.html image_width="90%" padding="500px" image_path="../images/IRAction_Website_Fig.png" description="An understanding of the mechanisms of bimolecular peroxy radical reactions is essential for predicting the importance of these reactions for a variety of precursors in the atmosphere. In this work, I am using laser spectroscopy to detect reaction transition states for organic peroxy radical reactions. This will allow us to better understand the mechanisms of these reactions and improve calculations of reaction energetics." %}
