abstract: In this study we revisit one of the simplest RO$_2$ + RO$_2$ reactions - the self-reaction of the ethene-derived hydroxyperoxy radical formed via sequential addition of OH and O$_2$ to ethene. Previous studies of this reaction suggested that the branching to ‘accretion products’, compounds containing the carbon backbone of both reactants, was minimal. Here, CF$_3$O$^-$ GC-CIMS is used to quantify the yields of ethylene glycol, glycolaldehyde, a hydroxy hydroperoxide produced from RO$_2$ + HO$_2$, and a C$_4$O$_4$H$_{10}$ accretion product. These experiments were performed in an environmental chamber at 993 hPa and 294 K. We provide evidence that the accretion product is likely dihydroxy diethyl peroxide (HOC$_2$H$_4$OOC$_2$H$_4$OH = ROOR) and forms in the gas-phase with a branching fraction of 23 ± 5%. We suggest a new channel in the RO$_2$ + RO$_2$ chemistry leading directly to the formation of HO$_2$ (together with glycolaldehyde and an alkoxy radical). Finally, by varying the ratio of the formation rate of RO$_2$ and HO$_2$ in our chamber, we constrain the ratio of the rate coefficient for the reaction of RO$_2$ + RO$_2$ to that of RO$_2$ + HO$_2$ and find that this ratio is 0.22 ± 0.07, consistent with previous flash photolysis studies.
