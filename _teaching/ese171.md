Atmospheric Chemistry (ESE 171) is a course designed for graduate students covering the chemistry of the troposphere and the stratosphere. I assisted with the transition of this course to an online format during the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to running small recitations and writing solutions to problem sets.
