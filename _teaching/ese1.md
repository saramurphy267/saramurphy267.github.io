Earth's Climate (ESE 1) is an undergraduate course designed to give first- and second-year students a broad introductory overview of Earth and climate science. I had the wonderful opportunity, as a TA for this course, to work directly with undergraduates and run weekly recitations for a small, consistent group of nine students, putting into practice active learning techniques and working to solidify student understanding of the course material.
