Earth's Biogeochemical Cycles (ESE 103) is the third class in the required introductory course sequence for graduate students in the Environmental Science and Engineering program. The course covers a wide range of content, including carbon cycling, nutrient cycling, and photosynthesis. Since I had the opportunity to TA this course twice, I was able to provide input on the structure of the class and the problem sets, giving me insight into course development and organization.
