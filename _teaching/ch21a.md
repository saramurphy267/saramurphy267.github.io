Ch21a is an undergraduate quantum chemistry course mostly taken by undergraduates in their third or fourth year majoring in Chemistry. In addition to having the opportunity to work with undergraduates during office hours, TA-ing this course gave me the opportunity expand my teaching experience to undergraduate chemistry courses alongside the environmental science courses I TA-ed within my department.
